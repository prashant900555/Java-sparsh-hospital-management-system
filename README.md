# Download the "Sparsh HMS Installation.exe" file & Install the software program in any drive except C. 
     [Note: Please don't install the software in C drive or your respective Program files drive.]  

This can be implemented as a Client-Server JAVA JDK environment, by using a single MySQL Server Workbench on a single workstation and remotely conencting to this system by using its IPv4 address on neighbouring workstations in the same Local Area Network. 

    Let the splash screen load;
    Then, select Admin, Doctor or Receptionist according to your preference of execution.

	In admin's login there are two Tab Pane's,i.e: Medicine Prescriptions & OPD Bill Items. Herein, the admin can add, update, delete new medicine prescriptions accordingly, and also have a summary of entered details.

	In the Reception Login, there are again 2 Options: IPD & OPD. IPD is for In Patients and OPD is for Out Pateints.

	In IPD Control Panel, the receptionist will firstly add the IPD Patient; his basic information as name, dob, age, address, etc. & then can save his details. While preparing the bill, you can select the patient from the table and edit in the Billing Tab Pane. Then, you can add the bill items accordingly (Room Charges, Misc Charges, ICU Charges, etc.). Then you can calculate the Total bill in Bill Summary and then Save the patient details. You can view the saved details in the IPD Patients History Tab Pane. You can even select the Patient from this history and edit, add new items, delete items and then update it again by clicking the save patient history button. Eventually, the receptionist can then Print the IPD Bill.

	In OPD Control Panel, the receptionist wil firstly add the OPD Patient; his basic information as name, dob, age, address, etc. & then can save his details. Then select the desired patient from the table and go to the Book Appointments Tab Pane and select the doctor, date and time and save the appointment. This appointment can be viewed by the Doctor and the Receptionist in the Show Appointments Tab Pane. The Receptionist can also save the day's total collection in the below table and then the "Total Amount Collected Upto Date", will get incremented. 

	In the Doctor Login, there are two Doctor Options, which are pre-made as Dr Satish & Dr Rashmi.

	In the Doctor's Control Panel, they can see the saved appointment details by the receptionist in the Show Appointments Tab Pane. There they will enter the fees Collected and press the corresponding button, wherein in the OPD Control Panel, the receptionist can see a Completed/Pending Status accordingly. The Doctor can also write Prescriptions, Fitness/Medical Certificate and look into the Past Medical History of the patient. Eventually, the doctor can then Print all these things accordingly. The doctor can also view the saved patients history in the last Tab Pane.

	All the printed bills, prescriptions and certificates are in the Software Installed Folder and can be viewed as a PDF.

	There is also a logout button and a close project button available on the top right corner of our project form.

	In this way, our project is executed and same steps were used to test our project.

Even if you see this project as a single installation executable file, there were efforts made to make this delightful GUI work.

If you liked the GUI and the working of the software application please feel free to contact me on the details given below for any further assistance in making Java Desktop Applications.
      
        Also the full code is not for sale, but for reference purpose; do contact me.
